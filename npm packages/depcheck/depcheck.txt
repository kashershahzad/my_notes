To clean up unused or unnecessary packages in your project, you can follow the steps below systematically. This process will help you identify and remove unused dependencies efficiently.


1. Use depcheck to Identify Unused Packages
depcheck is a popular tool to scan your project and list unused dependencies.

Steps:
Install depcheck globally or locally (if not already installed):





             npm install -g depcheck



Run depcheck in your project directory:




                   depcheck


Unused dependencies: Packages listed in package.json but not used in the project.
Missing dependencies: Packages you are using but not listed in package.json.



Example output:
Unused dependencies
* lodash
* moment

Missing dependencies
* react-dom
Review the list carefully. Sometimes, depcheck might miss packages dynamically loaded or used via configuration files.
